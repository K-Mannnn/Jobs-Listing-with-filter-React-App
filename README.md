## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Continuing on my Reac.js and this turned out to be quite challeging for me to use React features to filter items in the ReactDOM. Gettin stuch sometimes is the best thing that can happen to someone, now I have thorough understanding some of the main React Hooks.
